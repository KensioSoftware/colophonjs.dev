There are four places an image can go into a generated one: a logo in the
corner, an author's photo beside the footer, the post's own photograph, and a
picture behind everything else.

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  logo: { path: "brand/logo.svg" },
  background: {
    type: "image",
    source: { path: "brand/cover.jpg" },
    fit: "cover",
  },
});
```

A post supplies its own pictures through the `avatar` and `image` props, both
of which take a path or a `data:` URI:

```yaml
---
meta_img_props:
  template: photo
  title: Measuring text properly
  avatar: content/authors/hugh.jpg
  image: content/posts/measuring/hero.jpg
---
```

The difference between `image` and a background image is where it comes from
rather than what it looks like. A background is config, so it is the same
picture on every post; `image` belongs to the post, which is what the
[`photo` template](../../templates/) exists for.

## Where they come from

Anywhere `path` appears you can write `data` instead and pass the bytes, which
is what a config that fetches its logo at build time wants. Paths resolve from
the working directory, as [`fonts`](../fonts/) do, and are checked when the
config is resolved rather than when the image is drawn: an unreadable file is a
blank corner on every image in the build, and a blank corner does not say which
path was wrong.

The bytes are inlined into the SVG as a `data:` URI, so a generated image never
depends on a file being fetchable later, and they go into the
[rebuild stamp](../../rebuilds/) by content. Replacing a logo at the same path
renders every image drawn with it again.

## Formats

PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP and SVG. The format is read from the bytes rather than the
file extension, so a `.png` that is really a JPEG is still drawn.

**Text inside an SVG is not rendered.** A nested document is drawn without the
fonts the build loaded, so a wordmark comes out with its shapes and none of its
letters. Convert the text to paths before exporting it, or use a PNG.

## How big they come out

A logo's height is a fraction of the image being drawn, so the same file works
on a square and a landscape, and its width follows from the proportions of the
picture. Those are read out of the image's own header, which is why a wide
wordmark gets a wide slot and a round mark gets a square one.

WebP is the exception: its dimensions live in one of three chunk layouts
depending on how it was encoded, and rather than guess at bit-packed headers
this treats a WebP as square. A wide WebP logo will sit small in the middle of
its slot, so supply a wide logo as PNG or SVG.

## Where they are drawn

That is the template's business, and the built-ins put them here:

| Template   | Logo                           | Avatar             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| `banner`   | Top right, opposite the badge  | Before the footer  |
| `card`     | Top centre, above the title    | Before the footer  |
| `code`     | Not drawn                      | Not drawn          |
| `article`  | Top right, beside the tags     | Before the byline  |
| `quote`    | Not drawn                      | Before the speaker |
| `terminal` | Not drawn                      | Not drawn          |
| `release`  | Top right                      | Before the footer  |
| `stat`     | Top centre                     | Before the footer  |
| `photo`    | Top right, over the photograph | Before the footer  |
| `wordmark` | Centred, above the name        | Before the footer  |
| `docs`     | Top right, beside the trail    | Before the footer  |
| `event`    | Top centre                     | Before the footer  |

The text moves down to make room for a logo, so a title never runs into it.

A [template of your own](../../templates/) is handed all three on its context,
as `logo`, `avatar` and `picture`, already loaded, along with the `image`
primitive from [the layout toolkit](../../layout/) to draw them with. The
post's `image` prop arrives as `picture` because `image` is also the name of
that primitive, and a template destructuring its context would shadow the
function it needs to call.

## Photographs behind the text

A background image takes a `fit`: `cover` fills the image and crops whatever
does not fit, `contain` fits the whole picture in and shows `color` around it.

```ts
background: {
  type: "image",
  source: { path: "brand/cover.jpg" },
  fit: "contain",
  color: "#0f172a",
  scrim: { from: 0.3, to: 0.8 },
}
```

### The scrim is on by default

A photograph is light and dark wherever it likes, and white text over a bright
sky cannot be read. The scrim is the wash of colour between the picture and the
text, which is what keeps the text legible whatever the photograph is doing
behind it.

It defaults to a quarter of black at the top and about two thirds at the
bottom. It starts at a quarter rather than at nothing because a template is
free to put its text anywhere, and a wash that only darkens the bottom leaves a
centred title sitting on whatever the middle of the photograph happens to be.

Turn it down for a picture that is already dark, or off entirely:

```ts
scrim: { from: 0, to: 0 }
```

Set `color` to tint rather than shade, since a brand colour at a low opacity
over a photograph will tie a set of images together.

## Per size

`logo` and `background` are both [per-size overrides](../per-size-config/), so a
tall Pinterest pin can carry a different photograph, or none:

```ts
sizes: [
  SIZE_PRESETS.og,
  { ...SIZE_PRESETS.square, background: { type: "solid", color: "#0f172a" } },
],
```
